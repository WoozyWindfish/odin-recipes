<h2>Oden</h2>

<h4{font-weight:normal;}>
    Oden is a tough dish to pin a recipe to because there are many different versions of oden. Additionally, there are many different soups
    and the ingredients, while there are staples, can be whatever the people want to throw in. I will be using the ingredients
    most often found across Japan. You are likely to see this at food stalls and in resturaunts. But, more often in convienence stores.

<h4{font-weight:normal;}>
    Oden is particuarly great for the winter season. It is hearty, filling, and can be as healthy (or unhealthy) as you would like.
    Often, people gather in groups for "nabe parties" and eat oden and drink beer. It really is one of my favorite memories of being abroad in Japan.
    From my memories to your shopping list, I hope you and your loved ones can have a nabe party of your own. Enjoy!
