    <h2>Butajiru</h2>



    <h4{font-weight:normal;}>
        Butajiru (Pork soup) is another simple but delicious recipe from Japan.
        It is both hearty and healthy. It is versatile, easy to make, and is great
        for when you're feeling a bit under the weather.

    <h4{font-weight:normal;}>
        While there are many ways to make this soup, I will be
        focusing on a version I would often find in my school lunch
        teaching English at a Japanese public school. I hope you enjoy!
